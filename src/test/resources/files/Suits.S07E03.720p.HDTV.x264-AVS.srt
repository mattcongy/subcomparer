1
00:00:01,109 --> 00:00:02,568
Maybe you don't know
how babies are made.

2
00:00:02,569 --> 00:00:05,310
Because when people are trying,
they know they're trying!

3
00:00:05,311 --> 00:00:07,247
And just because no one
ever wants to try with you

4
00:00:07,248 --> 00:00:08,748
doesn't give you the right

5
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:10,516
to tell me how to run
my associates!

6
00:00:10,518 --> 00:00:12,485
I think Rachel should
handle the associates.

7
00:00:12,487 --> 00:00:15,021
I am up here;
Rachel's down here.

8
00:00:15,023 --> 00:00:16,422
And you don't give dominion
over the associates

9
00:00:16,424 --> 00:00:18,190
to someone down here.

10
00:00:18,192 --> 00:00:19,592
Which one of my clients
are you after?

11
00:00:19,594 --> 00:00:21,360
Because we both know
you can't have Pfizer.

12
00:00:21,362 --> 00:00:23,496
- Yes, I can.
- Then make me name partner.

13
00:00:23,498 --> 00:00:25,331
Harvey's making his friend
name partner.

14
00:00:25,333 --> 00:00:26,766
He's accused me
of being jealous,

15
00:00:26,768 --> 00:00:28,467
and I don't know what to do.

16
00:00:28,469 --> 00:00:30,469
- Are you jealous?
- Of course I'm goddamn jealous!

17
00:00:30,471 --> 00:00:33,572
If you keep letting your
emotions dictate your behavior,

18
00:00:33,574 --> 00:00:36,308
you won't need to worry
about being replaced.

19
00:00:36,310 --> 00:00:38,477
You'll drive Harvey away
all by yourself.

20
00:00:38,479 --> 00:00:40,813
Stop apologizing
and start intimidating.

21
00:00:40,815 --> 00:00:42,214
That's a hell of a slogan,
Harvey,

22
00:00:42,216 --> 00:00:43,783
but what does it actually mean?

23
00:00:43,785 --> 00:00:45,785
It means you go out,
you find a reporter,

24
00:00:45,787 --> 00:00:47,486
and you control the narrative.

25
00:00:47,488 --> 00:00:49,522
If I lose this case,
the only article that's

26
00:00:49,524 --> 00:00:51,357
gonna get written is that
I never should've been able

27
00:00:51,359 --> 00:00:53,059
to practice law
in the first place.

28
00:00:53,061 --> 00:00:55,161
If you can't figure out
a way to win,

29
00:00:55,163 --> 00:00:56,796
<i>maybe I shouldn't have brought</i>
<i>you back in the first place.</i>

30
00:00:56,798 --> 00:00:58,397
A reporter from
the "Times" is coming here.

31
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:00,232
We are doing an interview:

32
00:01:00,234 --> 00:01:02,635
"The Redemption
of a Fraudulent Lawyer."

33
00:01:02,637 --> 00:01:05,137
I don't want my behavior

34
00:01:05,139 --> 00:01:06,605
to drive a wedge between us,

35
00:01:06,607 --> 00:01:09,141
which means I accept Alex
as name partner.

36
00:01:09,143 --> 00:01:10,543
For what it's worth,
Alex is still coming,

37
00:01:10,545 --> 00:01:12,078
but not as name partner.

38
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:13,479
- Really?
- You're right.

39
00:01:13,481 --> 00:01:15,001
We can't water down
the firm like that.

40
00:01:18,653 --> 00:01:21,854
I have to say...

41
00:01:21,856 --> 00:01:23,856
I've been wanting this
for so long.

42
00:01:23,858 --> 00:01:27,560
Never in my wildest dreams
did I think it would come true.

43
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:31,330
We're the only name partners
now, Louis.

44
00:01:31,332 --> 00:01:33,566
And I meant it
when I said it.

45
00:01:33,568 --> 00:01:35,434
I want us to share
things like this.

46
00:01:35,436 --> 00:01:38,537
I can't tell you how
happy that makes me.

47
00:01:38,539 --> 00:01:40,406
You're not gonna
cry, are you?

48
00:01:40,408 --> 00:01:41,440
Are you kidding?
The last time I cried in here,

49
00:01:41,442 --> 00:01:43,109
I messed up the pH.

50
00:01:43,111 --> 00:01:44,577
I had a yeast infection
for weeks.

51
00:01:44,579 --> 00:01:46,445
You're not gonna do the other
thing you told me

52
00:01:46,447 --> 00:01:48,547
you did in the mud, are you?

53
00:01:48,549 --> 00:01:50,649
Harvey, I told you,
that was a one-time thing.

54
00:01:50,651 --> 00:01:52,518
And believe me,
you're no Missy Dietler.

55
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:54,286
Who's Missy Dietler?

56
00:01:54,288 --> 00:01:56,655
- What is he doing here?
- What do you mean?

57
00:01:56,657 --> 00:01:58,691
Harvey and I go mudding together
all the time.

58
00:01:58,693 --> 00:02:00,392
So why don't you lug yourself
out of there

59
00:02:00,394 --> 00:02:03,129
so I can get my tub back?
This is my tub.

60
00:02:03,131 --> 00:02:04,597
And you always told me it was
weird for male friends

61
00:02:04,599 --> 00:02:06,465
to mud together.

62
00:02:06,467 --> 00:02:09,201
But Harvey and I are
more than just friends.

63
00:02:09,203 --> 00:02:10,369
We're best friends.

64
00:02:14,208 --> 00:02:15,608
And then what did you do?

65
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:17,143
What do you think I did?
I called you.

66
00:02:17,145 --> 00:02:19,345
Louis, it was just a dream.

67
00:02:19,347 --> 00:02:21,347
Just a dream?
It was a goddamn mud-mare.

68
00:02:21,349 --> 00:02:22,681
Don't you get it?

69
00:02:22,683 --> 00:02:24,350
Harvey let his buddy
into my firm.

70
00:02:24,352 --> 00:02:26,185
Now he's in my mud.

71
00:02:26,187 --> 00:02:27,553
I mean, what's next?
I walk into my bathroom

72
00:02:27,555 --> 00:02:28,888
and I find him shitting
on my toothbrush?

73
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:30,456
Louis, we talked about this.

74
00:02:30,458 --> 00:02:32,424
If you let this
overwhelm you,

75
00:02:32,426 --> 00:02:35,361
you're going to bring about
the thing you're most afraid of.

76
00:02:36,564 --> 00:02:38,164
Did you hear me?

77
00:02:38,166 --> 00:02:39,932
He was in my mud.

78
00:02:39,934 --> 00:02:42,434
How the hell am I not supposed
to let that overwhelm me?

79
00:02:42,436 --> 00:02:44,270
Well...

80
00:02:44,272 --> 00:02:46,238
has it occurred to you

81
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:48,908
that instead of worrying
this Alex person

82
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:51,510
is going to come between you
and Harvey,

83
00:02:51,512 --> 00:02:54,313
you could use this
as an opportunity

84
00:02:54,315 --> 00:02:56,649
to make a new friend?

85
00:02:56,651 --> 00:02:58,684
That's the dumbest thing
I've ever heard.

86
00:02:58,686 --> 00:03:00,319
Be that as it may,

87
00:03:00,321 --> 00:03:02,254
as I see it,

88
00:03:02,256 --> 00:03:05,257
you have a chance to have
one more friend

89
00:03:05,259 --> 00:03:07,259
or one less friend.

90
00:03:07,261 --> 00:03:09,261
I suggest you go with one more.

91
00:03:12,967 --> 00:03:14,300
- Donna.
- Rachel.

92
00:03:14,302 --> 00:03:16,302
Can I get you two
anything?

93
00:03:16,304 --> 00:03:18,737
Coffee, tea, a copy of your
article in the "Sunday Times"?

94
00:03:18,739 --> 00:03:21,307
Don't need it. Read it
yesterday. Have one at home.

95
00:03:21,309 --> 00:03:23,309
And by one, he means ten.

96
00:03:23,311 --> 00:03:24,643
Are you sure you don't want to
take just one more look at it?

97
00:03:24,645 --> 00:03:26,512
I'm good.
Thanks, Donna.

98
00:03:26,514 --> 00:03:28,314
Okeydokey.

99
00:03:28,316 --> 00:03:29,415
You have a nice day.

100
00:03:30,785 --> 00:03:33,485
Something's going on with her,
I can tell.

101
00:03:33,487 --> 00:03:35,487
What do you mean?

102
00:03:35,489 --> 00:03:38,257
You telling me you didn't
notice that grin on her face?

103
00:03:38,259 --> 00:03:40,259
Rachel, you've known Donna
longer than I have,

104
00:03:40,261 --> 00:03:41,660
but I didn't see a grin.

105
00:03:41,662 --> 00:03:43,422
I'm telling you,
I think you're imagining it.

106
00:03:45,433 --> 00:03:47,800
Right. Totally imagined it.

107
00:03:47,802 --> 00:03:50,336
Harvey.
Rachel.

108
00:03:50,338 --> 00:03:52,404
You know,
black can be slimming.

109
00:03:52,406 --> 00:03:54,273
Something to think about
next time.

110
00:03:54,275 --> 00:03:55,674
I take it this is your
way of apologizing

111
00:03:55,676 --> 00:03:57,676
for saying you never
should've hired me back.

112
00:03:57,678 --> 00:03:59,778
And it gave me a chance to say
the slimming thing.

113
00:04:01,449 --> 00:04:03,549
Sorry, Mike.

114
00:04:03,551 --> 00:04:05,317
You had a point, Harvey.

115
00:04:10,324 --> 00:04:11,991
This is the Radiant
Technologies merger.

116
00:04:11,993 --> 00:04:13,659
Yep. Back to one for me.

117
00:04:13,661 --> 00:04:15,594
Great, except you don't
need me for this.

118
00:04:15,596 --> 00:04:17,529
Deal's done.
They sign tomorrow.

119
00:04:17,531 --> 00:04:19,832
Which is why Klein Robinson
thought that I wouldn't mind

120
00:04:19,834 --> 00:04:22,034
if they put a few last-minute
changes in the contract.

121
00:04:22,036 --> 00:04:23,736
And a few last-minute changes
means they're trying to pull

122
00:04:23,738 --> 00:04:25,638
some last-minute bullshit.

123
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,039
Now that sounds like
the impressive young lawyer

124
00:04:27,041 --> 00:04:28,774
I read about in the article.

125
00:04:28,776 --> 00:04:30,376
Why don't you figure out
what they're trying to do?

126
00:04:30,378 --> 00:04:32,678
And get it done by lunch.

127
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:37,549

Don't be hostile.

140
00:05:17,359 --> 00:05:18,658
Don't be hostile.

141
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:20,026
Louis, what are you doing?

142
00:05:20,028 --> 00:05:21,060
- What?
- Leave him alone.

143
00:05:21,062 --> 00:05:22,662
It's his first day.

144
00:05:22,664 --> 00:05:23,663
No, Donna, it's not like that.
I come in peace.

145
00:05:23,665 --> 00:05:25,098
You swear?

146
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:26,766
Yes, I brought him
a living thing.

147
00:05:26,768 --> 00:05:29,168
- Is it poisonous?
- No, Donna, it is not.

148
00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:31,838
Okay. Well, I got
my eyes on you.

149
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:34,040
And that plant.

150
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:36,109
Don't be hostile.

151
00:05:37,312 --> 00:05:39,145
Alex Williams, Louis Litt.

152
00:05:39,147 --> 00:05:40,146
I brought you a honeysuckle.

153
00:05:40,148 --> 00:05:42,215
Excuse me?

154
00:05:42,217 --> 00:05:44,651
It's a gesture, since we
might've gotten off

155
00:05:44,653 --> 00:05:46,319
on the wrong foot.

156
00:05:46,321 --> 00:05:47,720
You mean because you tried
to poach my biggest client

157
00:05:47,722 --> 00:05:49,322
and keep me from joining
the firm?

158
00:05:49,324 --> 00:05:51,424
Yes, perhaps that's the foot
we got off on.

159
00:05:51,426 --> 00:05:55,094
But I was hoping we could
get onto other foot.

160
00:05:55,096 --> 00:05:57,163
Here.

161
00:05:57,165 --> 00:05:59,866
I appreciate the gesture,
Louis.

162
00:05:59,868 --> 00:06:03,770
By the way, your work on the
Andersen case was extraordinary.

163
00:06:03,772 --> 00:06:05,738
You followed my Andersen work?

164
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:08,408
Yes. In fact, it reminded me
of my Pricehouse strategy.

165
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:11,210
Truth be told, I based it
on your Pricehouse strategy.

166
00:06:11,212 --> 00:06:13,446
Get the f--well then, you took
it to a whole other level.

167
00:06:13,448 --> 00:06:15,682
Thank you, Louis.

168
00:06:16,885 --> 00:06:19,152
I'm sorry about the poaching.

169
00:06:19,154 --> 00:06:20,687
Don't worry about it.

170
00:06:22,857 --> 00:06:25,291
Hey, would you
like to grab lunch?

171
00:06:25,293 --> 00:06:28,361
Eating at your desk is no way to
celebrate your first day.

172
00:06:28,363 --> 00:06:30,329
You're right, it's not.

173
00:06:30,331 --> 00:06:31,898
I'll meet you at the lobby
at 1:00.

174
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:33,800
Sounds good.
And thanks for the plant.

175
00:06:33,802 --> 00:06:35,702
You're welcome.

176
00:06:35,704 --> 00:06:37,270
I don't know if you care
about this, but cats love it.

177
00:06:37,272 --> 00:06:39,405
Oh, I know.
We've got two tabbies at home

178
00:06:39,407 --> 00:06:40,940
that are gonna go crazy
over that bad boy.

179
00:06:40,942 --> 00:06:42,709
- Tabbies?
- Yup.

180
00:06:42,711 --> 00:06:44,444
Holy shit, I'm gonna make
a reservation

181
00:06:44,446 --> 00:06:47,480
at the best restaurant
in the city, you... BFF, you.

182
00:06:48,783 --> 00:06:50,183
Son of a bitch.

183
00:06:52,487 --> 00:06:53,886
Mr. Reyes?

184
00:06:53,888 --> 00:06:55,755
- Yes.
- Mike Ross.

185
00:06:55,757 --> 00:06:57,223
They said you
wanted to see me?

186
00:06:57,225 --> 00:06:58,291
Yes, thank you for
taking the time.

187
00:06:58,293 --> 00:07:00,827
Of course.

188
00:07:00,829 --> 00:07:03,930
I read your interview
yesterday.

189
00:07:03,932 --> 00:07:05,832
And my son was
in prison too.

190
00:07:05,834 --> 00:07:08,868
But unlike you,

191
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:10,903
he didn't make it out.

192
00:07:12,407 --> 00:07:14,307
This says your son died
of a heart attack.

193
00:07:14,309 --> 00:07:16,809
-Yes, a heart attack out
of nowhere.

194
00:07:16,811 --> 00:07:18,277
You think they're
hiding something.

195
00:07:18,279 --> 00:07:19,512
Well, they won't
take my calls

196
00:07:19,514 --> 00:07:21,414
or answer my letters.

197
00:07:21,416 --> 00:07:23,149
What would you think?

198
00:07:23,151 --> 00:07:24,817
I'd think that there
might be something wrong.

199
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:27,453
But that doesn't
mean that there is.

200
00:07:27,455 --> 00:07:29,989
Mr. Ross, my son
was 28 years old.

201
00:07:29,991 --> 00:07:32,425
And he was up for
parole next month.

202
00:07:32,427 --> 00:07:34,427
There's something
they're not telling me.

203
00:07:34,429 --> 00:07:36,362
All right,
I'll look into it.

204
00:07:36,364 --> 00:07:40,399
Um, but I'm not gonna be able
to get to this for a few days.

205
00:07:40,401 --> 00:07:42,902
A few days.
Why can't you start now?

206
00:07:42,904 --> 00:07:45,371
Because I have a deal
with my firm that allows me

207
00:07:45,373 --> 00:07:48,307
to do cases like this,
but not only cases like this.

208
00:07:48,309 --> 00:07:50,376
And right now, I'm in the middle
of something else.

209
00:07:50,378 --> 00:07:53,312
Mr. Ross, the last
lawyer I talked to

210
00:07:53,314 --> 00:07:55,448
said there was some kind
of a statute

211
00:07:55,450 --> 00:07:58,851
that says I only have another
two weeks to file a lawsuit.

212
00:07:58,853 --> 00:08:01,420
And I'm telling you, two weeks
should be more than enough time,

213
00:08:01,422 --> 00:08:05,491
but I--I can't drop everything
just to take your case.

214
00:08:05,493 --> 00:08:07,326
I understand.

215
00:08:07,328 --> 00:08:09,028
But...

216
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:12,398
Chris was caught with
an ounce of marijuana.

217
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,333
He never should have been there
in the first place.

218
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:16,435
And if time runs out on this

219
00:08:16,437 --> 00:08:21,274
and I couldn't get him
justice...

220
00:08:21,276 --> 00:08:23,543
Okay.

221
00:08:23,545 --> 00:08:25,278
I'll see what I can do.

222
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:30,983
Stephanie, we need to talk
about this assignment.

223
00:08:30,985 --> 00:08:32,552
Is there a problem with it?

224
00:08:32,554 --> 00:08:34,987
Yes, the problem is
you didn't do it.

225
00:08:34,989 --> 00:08:36,923
Jason did.

226
00:08:36,925 --> 00:08:40,593
Because Jason is better at
cataloging procedure than I am.

227
00:08:40,595 --> 00:08:42,461
Right, but if you don't do
the things you're not good at,

228
00:08:42,463 --> 00:08:44,063
you'll never get better.

229
00:08:44,065 --> 00:08:45,398
The thing is, I don't really
want to get better

230
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,333
at cataloging procedure.

231
00:08:47,335 --> 00:08:49,335
I know that, just like
I didn't want to be a paralegal

232
00:08:49,337 --> 00:08:51,971
specializing in research for
as long as I was.

233
00:08:51,973 --> 00:08:54,607
But it turns out we
had a case last year

234
00:08:54,609 --> 00:08:57,944
that we only won because I was
outstanding at research.

235
00:08:59,881 --> 00:09:01,280
Okay, I see your point.

236
00:09:01,282 --> 00:09:03,516
I won't do it again.
Good.

237
00:09:03,518 --> 00:09:06,252
Because I have another case
that requires some procedure

238
00:09:06,254 --> 00:09:09,055
to be catalogued, and I put it
aside especially for you.

239
00:09:11,359 --> 00:09:12,959
But Stephanie, I want your word

240
00:09:12,961 --> 00:09:15,528
that you won't pawn
it off on Jason.

241
00:09:15,530 --> 00:09:17,330
You have my word.

242
00:09:25,874 --> 00:09:28,074
Well, look who it is.

243
00:09:28,076 --> 00:09:30,576
Don't tell me, you feel bad
about canceling the other night

244
00:09:30,578 --> 00:09:32,078
and now you're dying
to make it up to me.

245
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,013
It's as though you read
my mind.

246
00:09:34,015 --> 00:09:36,015
<i>One of my many skills.</i>

247
00:09:36,017 --> 00:09:38,017
How does dinner tonight sound?

248
00:09:38,019 --> 00:09:40,353
How does having it
at my place sound?

249
00:09:40,355 --> 00:09:41,554
You're a crafty one,
aren't you?

250
00:09:41,556 --> 00:09:43,289
What? I've got some steaks

251
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:44,957
I've been wanting to throw
on the grill.

252
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,592
No, you want to have dinner
at your place

253
00:09:46,594 --> 00:09:47,894
'cause it's the closest
restaurant in the city

254
00:09:47,896 --> 00:09:49,428
to your bedroom.

255
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:50,563
Did you read that
in "Zagat's"?

256
00:09:50,565 --> 00:09:52,331
No, I read your mind.

257
00:09:52,333 --> 00:09:53,900
Then what time am I thinking?

258
00:09:53,902 --> 00:09:55,568
How about 8:00?

259
00:09:55,570 --> 00:09:57,570
Better make it 8:30.
I got to go buy some steaks.

260
00:10:00,909 --> 00:10:02,541
Good, you're here.

261
00:10:02,543 --> 00:10:03,576
Tell me you figured out
what bullshit they're trying

262
00:10:03,578 --> 00:10:05,444
to sneak into this deal.

263
00:10:05,446 --> 00:10:06,913
They're not trying to sneak
anything into it.

264
00:10:06,915 --> 00:10:08,614
They're trying to
get out of it.

265
00:10:08,616 --> 00:10:10,683
That doesn't make sense.
They came to us for this merger.

266
00:10:10,685 --> 00:10:12,318
They must've gotten
a better offer,

267
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,319
because they buried
an escape clause

268
00:10:13,321 --> 00:10:15,121
in the addendum.

269
00:10:15,123 --> 00:10:17,690
- You know what we have to do.
- Yes, I do.

270
00:10:17,692 --> 00:10:20,126
But you're gonna have
to do it without me.

271
00:10:20,128 --> 00:10:21,527
Something's come up,
it's on a deadline,

272
00:10:21,529 --> 00:10:23,162
and I need to take care of it.

273
00:10:23,164 --> 00:10:25,131
- What kind of thing?
- A pro Bono thing.

274
00:10:25,133 --> 00:10:27,667
Since when does one for me
mean two for you?

275
00:10:27,669 --> 00:10:30,603
Harvey, a man died in prison
and it doesn't smell right.

276
00:10:30,605 --> 00:10:32,505
Also, the only reason I found
out about it is

277
00:10:32,507 --> 00:10:34,106
I took your advice
and did that interview.

278
00:10:34,108 --> 00:10:35,942
So it's my fault
that you're dropping my case?

279
00:10:35,944 --> 00:10:37,643
Yeah, I like to look at it
that way.

280
00:10:37,645 --> 00:10:41,147
Seriously, go get 'em.

281
00:10:41,149 --> 00:10:42,448
Thanks, Harvey.

282
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:47,353
The last guy brought me
a plant.

283
00:10:47,355 --> 00:10:48,988
Let me guess,
the last guy was Louis.

284
00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:50,656
- You got it.
- Well, I guarantee

285
00:10:50,658 --> 00:10:52,591
my welcome gift is a lot
more fun than his.

286
00:10:52,593 --> 00:10:54,493
Since when is a merger
signing fun?

287
00:10:54,495 --> 00:10:56,629
Since the guys on the other
side are trying to rip us off

288
00:10:56,631 --> 00:10:58,397
and think we don't know.

289
00:10:58,399 --> 00:10:59,966
Why didn't you tell me that in
the first place?

290
00:10:59,968 --> 00:11:01,600
Come on. I'll fill you in
on the way over.

291
00:11:01,602 --> 00:11:03,602
Wait, the meeting's now?

292
00:11:03,604 --> 00:11:04,971
Yeah, is that a problem?

293
00:11:04,973 --> 00:11:06,739
I told Louis we'd get lunch.

294
00:11:06,741 --> 00:11:08,641
Business trumps lunch.
Louis'll understand.

295
00:11:08,643 --> 00:11:10,242
Just call him
and let him know.

296
00:11:17,085 --> 00:11:18,985
Alex, hi, I was just on my way
to meet you.

297
00:11:18,987 --> 00:11:20,686
<i>About that, Louis.</i>
<i>I have to reschedule.</i>

298
00:11:20,688 --> 00:11:22,989
A work thing came up.
I hope you understand.

299
00:11:22,991 --> 00:11:24,390
<i>Yeah, of course.</i>

300
00:11:24,392 --> 00:11:27,193
Business comes first.
Thanks.

301
00:11:27,195 --> 00:11:29,275
We'll do it another time.
In fact, I'm free all week.

302
00:11:30,732 --> 00:11:33,466
Louis? You okay?

303
00:11:33,468 --> 00:11:35,001
Uh, yeah, I'm okay.

304
00:11:35,003 --> 00:11:38,004
I, uh--
it's allergy season.

305
00:11:38,006 --> 00:11:40,539
I--I think it's probably best
that we don't have lunch today.

306
00:11:40,541 --> 00:11:43,609
I, uh--my--my chest
feels like a vice.

307
00:11:45,546 --> 00:11:46,679
All good?

308
00:11:46,681 --> 00:11:48,247
I think so.

309
00:11:48,249 --> 00:11:50,249
What kind of plant
did he get you, anyway?

310
00:11:50,251 --> 00:11:52,752
- Honeysuckle.
- Huh.

311
00:11:52,754 --> 00:11:54,153
I never knew that
was an indoor plant.

312
00:11:54,155 --> 00:11:55,688
Can be.

313
00:11:55,690 --> 00:11:57,490
Matter of fact, our cats
are gonna love it.

314
00:11:57,492 --> 00:12:00,559
- You have cats?
- Why you gotta be like that?

315
00:12:00,561 --> 00:12:02,661
- Why you gotta have cats?
- I like my cats.

316
00:12:02,663 --> 00:12:04,497
No, you don't.

317
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:15,541
Ms. Snyder? Mike Ross.

318
00:12:15,543 --> 00:12:17,510
Is that name supposed to mean
something to me?

319
00:12:17,512 --> 00:12:20,579
No, but I'm representing
the family of Chris Reyes.

320
00:12:22,216 --> 00:12:23,449
Hoping that name does.

321
00:12:23,451 --> 00:12:24,817
Of course.

322
00:12:24,819 --> 00:12:26,118
Any time an inmate dies,

323
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:28,054
we take it very seriously.

324
00:12:28,056 --> 00:12:29,722
But not seriously enough to
give an accounting of his death

325
00:12:29,724 --> 00:12:32,158
despite repeated requests
by his family.

326
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,193
I received no such requests.

327
00:12:34,195 --> 00:12:35,661
It's a shame you didn't
call first.

328
00:12:35,663 --> 00:12:37,196
I could've prepared
something.

329
00:12:37,198 --> 00:12:38,697
I didn't want you
to be prepared,

330
00:12:38,699 --> 00:12:40,566
'cause I want to know what
actually happened.

331
00:12:40,568 --> 00:12:42,601
Mr. Ross,
when you do what I do,

332
00:12:42,603 --> 00:12:44,570
you get used to people assuming
the worst about your company,

333
00:12:44,572 --> 00:12:46,105
so I would appreciate
a little respect.

334
00:12:46,107 --> 00:12:47,606
Ms. Snyder, when
you do what I do,

335
00:12:47,608 --> 00:12:49,141
you get used to companies
proving you right,

336
00:12:49,143 --> 00:12:52,645
so I would appreciate
a little action.

337
00:12:59,754 --> 00:13:02,555
Apparently Mr. Reyes
was in a fight.

338
00:13:02,557 --> 00:13:04,323
He was sent to solitary,
where he complained

339
00:13:04,325 --> 00:13:06,092
of difficulty breathing.

340
00:13:06,094 --> 00:13:08,127
A doctor was called
and delivered treatment.

341
00:13:08,129 --> 00:13:10,129
Unfortunately, he died
a few hours later.

342
00:13:10,131 --> 00:13:11,630
Well, if he was in a fight,

343
00:13:11,632 --> 00:13:13,532
there has to be
an incident report.

344
00:13:13,534 --> 00:13:15,534
That may be, but you have
no right to access it.

345
00:13:15,536 --> 00:13:17,169
We're a private corporation.
That's privileged.

346
00:13:17,171 --> 00:13:18,571
Okay, then how about
you give me

347
00:13:18,573 --> 00:13:20,172
the names of the guards
who saw it?

348
00:13:20,174 --> 00:13:21,874
You know I can't give you
that either.

349
00:13:21,876 --> 00:13:23,342
And you know that if I bring
a suit against you,

350
00:13:23,344 --> 00:13:25,144
I'm gonna get all
of this anyway.

351
00:13:25,146 --> 00:13:28,114
So why don't you save yourself
the publicity

352
00:13:28,116 --> 00:13:29,715
and just give it to me now?

353
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:38,927
I don't care what that
thing says.

354
00:13:38,929 --> 00:13:41,029
It's not the whole story.

355
00:13:41,031 --> 00:13:43,265
Mr. Reyes, I know this isn't
what you wanted to hear,

356
00:13:43,267 --> 00:13:44,966
but I'm not seeing a case.

357
00:13:44,968 --> 00:13:47,702
It says there that my son

358
00:13:47,704 --> 00:13:49,638
died alone in solitary
confinement.

359
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:50,872
Why didn't they take him
to an infirmary?

360
00:13:50,874 --> 00:13:52,574
Because he was seen
by a doctor.

361
00:13:52,576 --> 00:13:53,909
There was an explanation
for his symptoms.

362
00:13:53,911 --> 00:13:55,810
I know you think
I'm just a man

363
00:13:55,812 --> 00:13:57,879
who can't accept
his child's death.

364
00:13:57,881 --> 00:13:59,814
But that's not true.

365
00:13:59,816 --> 00:14:02,083
Mr. Reyes, a fight in prison
can elevate your heart rate.

366
00:14:02,085 --> 00:14:03,752
Nobody knows that
better than I do.

367
00:14:03,754 --> 00:14:06,755
What they're saying happened
is plausible.

368
00:14:06,757 --> 00:14:08,590
Then you didn't know my son.

369
00:14:08,592 --> 00:14:11,259
I told you, he was up
for parole next month.

370
00:14:11,261 --> 00:14:13,328
He wouldn't have gotten
into a fight.

371
00:14:13,330 --> 00:14:15,330
What exactly are you saying?

372
00:14:15,332 --> 00:14:16,665
One of those inmates

373
00:14:16,667 --> 00:14:18,967
must have come for him.

374
00:14:18,969 --> 00:14:21,336
And that prison didn't give
enough of a shit about Chris

375
00:14:21,338 --> 00:14:23,772
to protect him.

376
00:14:23,774 --> 00:14:25,574
Mr. Reyes, I know that
you came to me

377
00:14:25,576 --> 00:14:27,008
because that article said
I wanted to help people

378
00:14:27,010 --> 00:14:29,611
and I do, but...

379
00:14:29,613 --> 00:14:32,113
I know.
My son's already dead.

380
00:14:32,115 --> 00:14:35,016
But if they could've
stopped this and they didn't,

381
00:14:35,018 --> 00:14:37,118
it's going to happen again.

382
00:14:45,796 --> 00:14:48,830
Chase, I'd like you to meet
our newest senior partner,

383
00:14:48,832 --> 00:14:50,665
Alex Williams.

384
00:14:50,667 --> 00:14:52,634
Two senior partners just
to sign a contract.

385
00:14:52,636 --> 00:14:54,336
Seems excessive.

386
00:14:54,338 --> 00:14:56,838
It would be, but we're
not here to sign anything.

387
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:57,973
What are you talking about?

388
00:14:57,975 --> 00:14:59,774
He must think I'm pretty dumb.

389
00:14:59,776 --> 00:15:01,610
People always underestimate
a pretty face.

390
00:15:01,612 --> 00:15:02,911
Maybe he just thinks
you're dumb.

391
00:15:02,913 --> 00:15:04,613
'Cause of the droopy eyes.

392
00:15:04,615 --> 00:15:06,615
Valid theory.
Not unprecedented.

393
00:15:06,617 --> 00:15:08,049
Nobody thinks you're dumb.

394
00:15:08,051 --> 00:15:09,651
Then why the hell did you
sneak this clause

395
00:15:09,653 --> 00:15:11,353
to the back of my
goddamn contract?

396
00:15:11,355 --> 00:15:12,921
We didn't sneak anything.

397
00:15:12,923 --> 00:15:14,789
We were just looking
at our options.

398
00:15:14,791 --> 00:15:16,858
Bullshit. You're trying
to use us as a stalking horse

399
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:18,927
so you can merge with Gorban.

400
00:15:18,929 --> 00:15:20,895
So what if I was?

401
00:15:20,897 --> 00:15:22,731
What are you going to do
to stop it?

402
00:15:22,733 --> 00:15:24,733
I'll tell you what I did.
I called Alex.

403
00:15:24,735 --> 00:15:27,335
And what I did was call my
law school roommate at the DOJ

404
00:15:27,337 --> 00:15:29,337
about the anti-trust issues
raised by you

405
00:15:29,339 --> 00:15:30,639
merging with Gorban.

406
00:15:32,943 --> 00:15:34,409
What do you want?

407
00:15:34,411 --> 00:15:36,111
We want you to live up
to the terms

408
00:15:36,113 --> 00:15:38,680
of the original agreement.
With one exception.

409
00:15:38,682 --> 00:15:40,749
You're gonna
take a step down.

410
00:15:40,751 --> 00:15:42,851
- I'm not stepping down.
- Yes, you are.

411
00:15:42,853 --> 00:15:45,654
This new company doesn't need
two outside counsels.

412
00:15:45,656 --> 00:15:47,756
Particularly one who tries
to pull shady shit

413
00:15:47,758 --> 00:15:49,858
without his client
knowing about it.

414
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:51,826
Looks like you're gonna
take one for the team, Chase.

415
00:15:51,828 --> 00:15:56,097
The question is, would you like
to bow out or get kicked out?

416
00:16:02,039 --> 00:16:03,838
<i>How the hell</i>
<i>can I calm down?</i>

417
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:05,373
<i>I was watching my mud-mare</i>
<i>come true.</i>

418
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:07,108
You don't know
what you saw, Louis.

419
00:16:07,110 --> 00:16:09,010
<i>I'm sorry, I forgot</i>
<i>I was blind.</i>

420
00:16:09,012 --> 00:16:11,379
I must've dialed your number
using my Braille-a-phone.

421
00:16:11,381 --> 00:16:13,014
You know that's not
what I meant.

422
00:16:13,016 --> 00:16:14,816
No, you're right,
it's the only explanation

423
00:16:14,818 --> 00:16:16,751
as to why I wouldn't
know what I just saw,

424
00:16:16,753 --> 00:16:19,988
which was Harvey and Alex,
arm in arm, laughing at me!

425
00:16:19,990 --> 00:16:22,157
Louis, listen to me.

426
00:16:22,159 --> 00:16:24,025
We knew this was
going to happen.

427
00:16:24,027 --> 00:16:25,794
That I was gonna be betrayed
by my best friend?

428
00:16:25,796 --> 00:16:27,796
No, that you were going to try
to be good--

429
00:16:27,798 --> 00:16:29,864
<i>- Did it.</i>
- Try not to be you.

430
00:16:29,866 --> 00:16:31,232
<i>- Accomplished.</i>
- Then perceive

431
00:16:31,234 --> 00:16:33,134
a potentially
nonexistent slight

432
00:16:33,136 --> 00:16:36,104
and go straight
to stage seven.

433
00:16:36,106 --> 00:16:37,872
What the hell are you
talking about?

434
00:16:37,874 --> 00:16:40,208
<i>Panic, sorrow, self-loathing,</i>

435
00:16:40,210 --> 00:16:45,980
hatred, justification,
self-loathing again, and rage.

436
00:16:45,982 --> 00:16:48,483
I call it
the seven stages of Louis.

437
00:16:48,485 --> 00:16:50,118
You are so full of shit,

438
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:52,887
and you're a total fraud,
and I'm actually gonna--

439
00:16:52,889 --> 00:16:54,456
ah, uh, I see your point.

440
00:16:54,458 --> 00:16:56,991
Stage 7b.

441
00:16:56,993 --> 00:16:59,260
No one likes a gloater, Stan.

442
00:16:59,262 --> 00:17:01,229
Be that as it may.

443
00:17:01,231 --> 00:17:02,997
You need a strategy, Louis.

444
00:17:02,999 --> 00:17:05,166
For now and the next time
this happens.

445
00:17:05,168 --> 00:17:07,435
The breathing exercises.

446
00:17:07,437 --> 00:17:09,804
<i>It's the only thing</i>
<i>that's ever worked for you.</i>

447
00:17:11,241 --> 00:17:14,175
What would I do
without you, Doc?

448
00:17:14,177 --> 00:17:17,979
No need to go down
that road, my friend.

449
00:17:17,981 --> 00:17:22,117
Now, picture yourself near
the ocean,

450
00:17:22,119 --> 00:17:24,052
<i>laying in the sand.</i>

451
00:17:24,054 --> 00:17:25,987
<i>Isn't it lovely?</i>

452
00:17:28,925 --> 00:17:30,058
I got to say,
that was pretty fun.

453
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:31,926
I agree.

454
00:17:31,928 --> 00:17:34,062
I always wanted to pretend I had
a friend at the DOJ.

455
00:17:34,064 --> 00:17:35,230
Not a bad first day.

456
00:17:35,232 --> 00:17:37,298
Speaking of my first day,

457
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:39,000
what's up with that
Louis Litt guy?

458
00:17:39,002 --> 00:17:41,136
- What do you mean?
- I don't know.

459
00:17:41,138 --> 00:17:42,504
First he tries to stop me
from coming over,

460
00:17:42,506 --> 00:17:44,038
then he brings me a plant,

461
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:45,940
then when I called
to cancel lunch,

462
00:17:45,942 --> 00:17:48,209
I could've sworn he was
about to cry or something.

463
00:17:48,211 --> 00:17:49,811
What?

464
00:17:51,515 --> 00:17:53,982
Louis is...

465
00:17:53,984 --> 00:17:55,550
he's complicated.

466
00:17:55,552 --> 00:17:58,052
What do you mean,
complicated?

467
00:17:58,054 --> 00:18:00,321
Well, you know he didn't
want you here, right?

468
00:18:00,323 --> 00:18:02,791
The thing is,
it wasn't professional.

469
00:18:02,793 --> 00:18:05,126
What else could it be?

470
00:18:05,128 --> 00:18:06,795
He was worried that
I was gonna be

471
00:18:06,797 --> 00:18:08,263
better friends
with you than him.

472
00:18:08,265 --> 00:18:10,832
What the hell
is wrong with this guy?

473
00:18:10,834 --> 00:18:12,066
Does he have a crush on you?

474
00:18:12,068 --> 00:18:13,902
No.

475
00:18:13,904 --> 00:18:16,070
Yeah, he totally
has a crush on me.

476
00:18:16,072 --> 00:18:17,806
But not like that.

477
00:18:17,808 --> 00:18:20,208
Maybe this'll work.
You ever seen "MASH"?

478
00:18:20,210 --> 00:18:22,277
Of course, but what does that
have to do with this?

479
00:18:22,279 --> 00:18:24,579
Louis is Frank Burns.

480
00:18:24,581 --> 00:18:26,214
Oh.

481
00:18:26,216 --> 00:18:28,183
Why didn't you say so
in the first place?

482
00:18:28,185 --> 00:18:29,317
Now I totally get it.

483
00:18:29,319 --> 00:18:31,019
- You sure?
- Yeah.

484
00:18:31,021 --> 00:18:33,288
He loves you, hates you,
and wants to be you,

485
00:18:33,290 --> 00:18:34,856
all at the same time.

486
00:18:34,858 --> 00:18:35,990
Huh, you do get it.

487
00:18:35,992 --> 00:18:38,860
Yeah, I do.
The question is,

488
00:18:38,862 --> 00:18:40,361
are you sure he's gonna
be okay with me,

489
00:18:40,363 --> 00:18:41,996
or do I have to watch out?

490
00:18:41,998 --> 00:18:43,998
Well, let me ask you this.

491
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,100
Did you tell him your cats
are gonna love his honeysuckle?

492
00:18:46,102 --> 00:18:47,368
Yes.

493
00:18:47,370 --> 00:18:48,603
Then I think
you'll be fine.

494
00:18:52,576 --> 00:18:55,243
Excuse me.
You guys know Chris Reyes?

495
00:18:55,245 --> 00:18:57,111
Doesn't ring a bell.

496
00:18:57,113 --> 00:18:59,180
That's strange, 'cause
according to the incident report

497
00:18:59,182 --> 00:19:01,149
the three of you were on duty
the night he died.

498
00:19:01,151 --> 00:19:03,017
Even if I were, I wouldn't
have anything to say about it,

499
00:19:03,019 --> 00:19:04,886
so you can get the fu--
out of here.

500
00:19:04,888 --> 00:19:05,920
Hey, come on. I just have
a few questions, that's all.

501
00:19:05,922 --> 00:19:07,222
This is a prison.

502
00:19:07,224 --> 00:19:08,857
All questions go through
the main office.

503
00:19:08,859 --> 00:19:10,258
Where do you think
I got your names?

504
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:12,026
I don't give a shit
where you got 'em.

505
00:19:12,028 --> 00:19:14,028
You're gonna forget
you ever heard 'em.

506
00:19:14,030 --> 00:19:15,864
And if I see your face again,
there's gonna be a problem.

507
00:19:15,866 --> 00:19:17,966
Okay, look, I'm not trying
to start any trouble here.

508
00:19:17,968 --> 00:19:20,301
But a man is dead, and I need
to find out what happened.

509
00:19:20,303 --> 00:19:22,203
For a guy who's not looking
to cause any trouble,

510
00:19:22,205 --> 00:19:23,605
you sure don't listen too good.

511
00:19:23,607 --> 00:19:25,039
Come on, Drew.
Let's go.

512
00:19:25,041 --> 00:19:26,307
That's what he wants.

513
00:19:26,309 --> 00:19:28,042
I'm telling you,
he's not worth it.

514
00:19:40,991 --> 00:19:42,624
You're one of those assholes
who just love

515
00:19:42,626 --> 00:19:44,192
getting the shit beat
out of him, aren't you?

516
00:19:44,194 --> 00:19:45,927
No, I've had the shit
beat out of me,

517
00:19:45,929 --> 00:19:47,328
and I can tell you,
I didn't love it at all.

518
00:19:47,330 --> 00:19:48,429
Then you better get the hell
out of here

519
00:19:48,431 --> 00:19:50,198
before it happens again.

520
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:52,333
I will, just as soon
as you answer my questions.

521
00:19:52,335 --> 00:19:54,068
And why would I do that?

522
00:19:54,070 --> 00:19:56,137
Because your name is
at the top of the list,

523
00:19:56,139 --> 00:19:58,406
and I'm guessing
you know what that means.

524
00:19:58,408 --> 00:20:00,642
Yeah, I'm the scapegoat.

525
00:20:00,644 --> 00:20:02,610
But it also means anything they
get, they know it came from me.

526
00:20:02,612 --> 00:20:04,145
Except you just told me
to go to hell

527
00:20:04,147 --> 00:20:05,680
in front of all your buddies,

528
00:20:05,682 --> 00:20:08,683
and they saw you meant it.

529
00:20:08,685 --> 00:20:11,219
That's why you came to me
at the prison.

530
00:20:11,221 --> 00:20:13,688
Now you got cover.

531
00:20:13,690 --> 00:20:16,291
And I suggest you use it.

532
00:20:16,293 --> 00:20:18,226
Because I am gonna find out
what happened here,

533
00:20:18,228 --> 00:20:20,929
and when I do, they are gonna
shield themselves from liability

534
00:20:20,931 --> 00:20:23,064
and I am gonna end up
coming after you instead.

535
00:20:23,066 --> 00:20:25,633
Or you can tell me
what I need to know,

536
00:20:25,635 --> 00:20:27,302
and I'll leave you out of it.

537
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:31,039
I'm the one who pulled him
out of the fight

538
00:20:31,041 --> 00:20:33,041
and threw him in the hole.

539
00:20:33,043 --> 00:20:35,243
He started complaining saying he
was having problems breathing.

540
00:20:35,245 --> 00:20:37,679
I told my supervisor, and my
supervisor said he was gonna

541
00:20:37,681 --> 00:20:39,414
call the doctor.

542
00:20:39,416 --> 00:20:42,083
That's all I know.
Bullshit that's all you know.

543
00:20:42,085 --> 00:20:43,418
Look, did Chris get killed
because he was onto something?

544
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:45,420
- No.
- Well, that kid,

545
00:20:45,422 --> 00:20:47,255
he didn't just up and get
in a fight without good reason.

546
00:20:47,257 --> 00:20:48,423
You don't know what
you're talking about.

547
00:20:48,425 --> 00:20:49,991
Look, are the guards corrupt?

548
00:20:49,993 --> 00:20:51,693
What the hell
did you just say?

549
00:20:51,695 --> 00:20:53,995
- Was somebody out to get him?
- No, he just died!

550
00:20:53,997 --> 00:20:55,396
Look, there's no conspiracy.

551
00:20:55,398 --> 00:20:56,998
Nobody's evil.

552
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,499
Just cheap.

553
00:20:58,501 --> 00:21:00,368
What does that mean?

554
00:21:00,370 --> 00:21:02,136
It means the only reason they
were able to wale on him

555
00:21:02,138 --> 00:21:03,671
for as long as they did is
'cause they didn't have

556
00:21:03,673 --> 00:21:05,406
enough of us on duty that night,

557
00:21:05,408 --> 00:21:07,008
'cause the prison doesn't give
a shit about anything

558
00:21:07,010 --> 00:21:08,309
except its bottom line.

559
00:21:14,753 --> 00:21:16,920
So what did you do?

560
00:21:16,922 --> 00:21:18,522
So I told him he could
have the money,

561
00:21:18,524 --> 00:21:19,857
but if--if he tried
taking those albums,

562
00:21:19,859 --> 00:21:21,525
we're gonna have trouble.

563
00:21:25,798 --> 00:21:27,030
This was lovely.

564
00:21:28,968 --> 00:21:30,801
But I have an early
morning tomorrow.

565
00:21:30,803 --> 00:21:32,536
I think I should get home.

566
00:21:32,538 --> 00:21:35,005
Paula, what's going on?

567
00:21:35,007 --> 00:21:36,106
It's nothing.

568
00:21:36,108 --> 00:21:38,709
Really.
Nothing?

569
00:21:38,711 --> 00:21:40,110
We had a great night.

570
00:21:40,112 --> 00:21:41,879
All of a sudden
you have to go?

571
00:21:41,881 --> 00:21:43,747
You wouldn't understand.

572
00:21:43,749 --> 00:21:45,182
Try me.

573
00:21:47,887 --> 00:21:50,754
I had lunch with the woman who
was my mentor today.

574
00:21:50,756 --> 00:21:51,989
And we were having
a wonderful time

575
00:21:51,991 --> 00:21:53,056
catching up with each other,

576
00:21:53,058 --> 00:21:54,858
and then... out of the blue,

577
00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:57,094
she asked me if I
was seeing anyone.

578
00:21:57,096 --> 00:21:59,096
I said no.

579
00:21:59,098 --> 00:22:00,998
Well, we haven't exactly
been seeing each other

580
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,866
for very long.
It's understandable if you--

581
00:22:02,868 --> 00:22:04,535
No, it wasn't that, Harvey.

582
00:22:05,905 --> 00:22:08,872
It's that I felt a little...
What?

583
00:22:08,874 --> 00:22:10,941
Ashamed.

584
00:22:10,943 --> 00:22:12,876
Ashamed.

585
00:22:12,878 --> 00:22:14,311
This isn't a small thing,
what we're doing, Harvey.

586
00:22:14,313 --> 00:22:16,947
At least it's not to me.
It's not to me either.

587
00:22:16,949 --> 00:22:21,018
Well, I'm not sure I realized
exactly how not small it is

588
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:23,020
until today.

589
00:22:23,022 --> 00:22:24,021
I don't understand.
We've been over this.

590
00:22:24,023 --> 00:22:25,756
It's in writing.

591
00:22:25,758 --> 00:22:27,324
There's no violation with
us seeing each other.

592
00:22:27,326 --> 00:22:28,926
This isn't something that I am

593
00:22:28,928 --> 00:22:30,027
trying to get away with,
Harvey.

594
00:22:30,029 --> 00:22:32,095
It's how I'm feeling inside.

595
00:22:33,832 --> 00:22:36,166
- So what are you saying?
- I'm not saying anything.

596
00:22:36,168 --> 00:22:40,604
I'm just saying I think I should
sleep at my place tonight.

597
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:50,247
Donna, I need to talk to you
about something.

598
00:22:50,249 --> 00:22:51,882
About what?

599
00:22:51,884 --> 00:22:53,050
About the fact that
I'm pissed off.

600
00:22:53,052 --> 00:22:54,785
What's going on?

601
00:22:54,787 --> 00:22:56,153
I gave Stephanie Patel
an assignment

602
00:22:56,155 --> 00:22:57,621
and she handed it off.

603
00:22:57,623 --> 00:22:59,056
Did you talk to her about it?

604
00:22:59,058 --> 00:23:00,624
Yes, I did, and she
gave me her word

605
00:23:00,626 --> 00:23:02,626
that she would never
do it again, but she did.

606
00:23:02,628 --> 00:23:04,194
I don't understand.
This has Stephanie's name on it.

607
00:23:04,196 --> 00:23:05,862
I don't care whose
name is on it.

608
00:23:05,864 --> 00:23:06,930
There's no way that
that wasn't written

609
00:23:06,932 --> 00:23:08,332
by a first-year associate.

610
00:23:08,334 --> 00:23:09,900
Rachel, please tell me you're
not thinking

611
00:23:09,902 --> 00:23:11,068
about going to Louis with this.

612
00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:12,336
Are you kidding me?

613
00:23:12,338 --> 00:23:14,104
We took Louis off the associates

614
00:23:14,106 --> 00:23:16,139
because of his
incident with Stephanie.

615
00:23:16,141 --> 00:23:19,209
If I tell him that she's being
insubordinate, he'll kill her.

616
00:23:19,211 --> 00:23:21,244
Well, I can't believe
I'm saying this,

617
00:23:21,246 --> 00:23:25,048
but maybe you should take a page
out of Louis' book.

618
00:23:25,050 --> 00:23:26,650
What do you mean?

619
00:23:26,652 --> 00:23:28,285
When Louis first took over
the associates,

620
00:23:28,287 --> 00:23:31,188
he used to plant a fake
associate and fire him

621
00:23:31,190 --> 00:23:32,990
in front of the entire class
on day one.

622
00:23:32,992 --> 00:23:34,958
And I used to think
he was crazy,

623
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:37,194
but Stephanie never would have
pulled something like this

624
00:23:37,196 --> 00:23:38,362
with Louis.
Okay, first of all,

625
00:23:38,364 --> 00:23:40,263
that's just not
how I operate.

626
00:23:40,265 --> 00:23:42,232
And second of all,
they've all been here.

627
00:23:42,234 --> 00:23:44,001
They'd all be able to tell
that it was fake.

628
00:23:44,003 --> 00:23:46,937
Then maybe you need
to real fire her.

629
00:23:46,939 --> 00:23:49,272
Because this is a second offense
and if you keep letting it go,

630
00:23:49,274 --> 00:23:50,374
where does it end?

631
00:23:50,376 --> 00:23:52,009
I'm not gonna do that.

632
00:23:52,011 --> 00:23:53,377
Do you mind if I ask you
why not?

633
00:23:53,379 --> 00:23:55,245
Because I don't want my
first official act

634
00:23:55,247 --> 00:23:57,147
to be firing someone.
I understand that, Rachel.

635
00:23:57,149 --> 00:23:58,982
But you better think
of something.

636
00:23:58,984 --> 00:24:00,984
Because the one thing
that Louis understood

637
00:24:00,986 --> 00:24:02,986
was that you've got to come out
of the gate in command,

638
00:24:02,988 --> 00:24:04,988
or they're gonna
walk all over you.

639
00:24:11,096 --> 00:24:12,262
Yes?

640
00:24:12,264 --> 00:24:14,264
Mr. Reyes, it's Mike Ross.

641
00:24:14,266 --> 00:24:15,666
I went to the prison, and I
talked to one of the guards.

642
00:24:15,668 --> 00:24:17,668
What did he say?

643
00:24:17,670 --> 00:24:19,903
He said all the prison cares
about is their bottom line.

644
00:24:19,905 --> 00:24:22,439
So I'm filing a lawsuit tonight.

645
00:24:22,441 --> 00:24:24,941
Thank you so much, Mr. Ross.

646
00:24:26,412 --> 00:24:29,112
I thought that article was maybe
too good to be true.

647
00:24:29,114 --> 00:24:31,682
I appreciate that, Oscar,
but don't thank me

648
00:24:31,684 --> 00:24:33,717
until I get you
the answers you're looking for.

649
00:24:43,195 --> 00:24:45,429
You finished
the paperwork already?

650
00:24:45,431 --> 00:24:47,297
I might have to give you
a raise.

651
00:24:47,299 --> 00:24:48,999
Save your money, Harvey.

652
00:24:49,001 --> 00:24:50,000
I'm here about something else.

653
00:24:50,002 --> 00:24:51,435
What's going on?

654
00:24:51,437 --> 00:24:53,437
I just heard Mike Ross
is handling a pro bono.

655
00:24:53,439 --> 00:24:56,339
Yeah, we have a deal. Why?
You need him for something?

656
00:24:56,341 --> 00:24:59,342
Yeah, I need him
to drop that case.

657
00:24:59,344 --> 00:25:01,211
Why?

658
00:25:01,213 --> 00:25:02,713
Because there's a conflict
with Masterson Construction.

659
00:25:02,715 --> 00:25:04,414
Mike's pro bono is against
some prison.

660
00:25:04,416 --> 00:25:06,016
And guess who builds
those prisons.

661
00:25:06,018 --> 00:25:07,350
Wait a second.

662
00:25:07,352 --> 00:25:09,152
Are you telling me to go
back on my word

663
00:25:09,154 --> 00:25:10,721
because your client's
bullying you?

664
00:25:10,723 --> 00:25:12,222
Harvey, I thought
we were in this together.

665
00:25:12,224 --> 00:25:13,924
- So did I.
- Then get on board.

666
00:25:13,926 --> 00:25:15,058
Because they're not
just any client.

667
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:16,460
They're one of my biggest.

668
00:25:16,462 --> 00:25:18,395
And if they leave
because you chose some prisoner

669
00:25:18,397 --> 00:25:20,063
over one of the biggest
developers in the country,

670
00:25:20,065 --> 00:25:21,765
people are gonna get the message

671
00:25:21,767 --> 00:25:23,734
that we don't want to be
in the real estate business.

672
00:25:23,736 --> 00:25:25,135
Did they say they were gonna
give people that message?

673
00:25:25,137 --> 00:25:26,737
- Harvey--
- Did they or not?

674
00:25:26,739 --> 00:25:28,205
- They did.
- Drop 'em.

675
00:25:28,207 --> 00:25:29,406
- God damn it--
- I said drop 'em.

676
00:25:29,408 --> 00:25:30,741
- No.
- Excuse me?

677
00:25:30,743 --> 00:25:32,309
I may not be name partner yet,

678
00:25:32,311 --> 00:25:34,111
but you don't get to tell me
who my clients are.

679
00:25:34,113 --> 00:25:35,212
Yes, I do.

680
00:25:35,214 --> 00:25:37,414
Harvey, listen to yourself.

681
00:25:37,416 --> 00:25:39,382
It's one pro bono.
He just took it.

682
00:25:39,384 --> 00:25:41,084
He can drop it.

683
00:25:43,288 --> 00:25:44,988
I gave him my word.

684
00:25:44,990 --> 00:25:46,389
And you once gave
your word to me

685
00:25:46,391 --> 00:25:48,391
and went back on it
and I let it go.

686
00:25:48,393 --> 00:25:50,494
Because I understood
it was business.

687
00:25:50,496 --> 00:25:53,029
If this kid doesn't get that,
what the hell is he doing here?

688
00:26:00,239 --> 00:26:03,273
Stephanie, I asked you to come
to my office.

689
00:26:03,275 --> 00:26:04,541
That was over an hour ago.

690
00:26:04,543 --> 00:26:06,243
I was working on
the Sanderson brief.

691
00:26:06,245 --> 00:26:07,778
I was about to come down.

692
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:09,446
Well, I need to talk
to you now,

693
00:26:09,448 --> 00:26:11,214
because you told me that
you wouldn't hand this off,

694
00:26:11,216 --> 00:26:13,083
and you did.

695
00:26:13,085 --> 00:26:14,518
No, I told you that I wouldn't
hand it off to Jason,

696
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:16,386
and I didn't.

697
00:26:16,388 --> 00:26:17,420
I'm sorry, are you trying
to get out of this

698
00:26:17,422 --> 00:26:19,156
on a technicality?

699
00:26:19,158 --> 00:26:21,491
I'm your supervisor,
not opposing counsel.

700
00:26:21,493 --> 00:26:24,194
Rachel, I tried to be nice
about this,

701
00:26:24,196 --> 00:26:26,363
but I'm a fourth-year associate,

702
00:26:26,365 --> 00:26:27,998
and I'm not wasting my time

703
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,533
on something a first-year
could handle.

704
00:26:29,535 --> 00:26:32,169
Now, if you don't mind, I would
like to get back to work.

705
00:26:33,338 --> 00:26:35,071
Actually, I do mind.

706
00:26:35,073 --> 00:26:37,574
Excuse me, Stephanie,
I'm speaking to you.

707
00:26:37,576 --> 00:26:40,110
It doesn't matter
what year you are.

708
00:26:40,112 --> 00:26:41,444
I'm head of the associates.

709
00:26:41,446 --> 00:26:43,380
If I give you an assignment,
you do it.

710
00:26:43,382 --> 00:26:45,515
And when you give me one
that's worth my time, I will.

711
00:26:45,517 --> 00:26:46,550
What's going on here?

712
00:26:46,552 --> 00:26:48,285
Donna, I'm handling it.

713
00:26:48,287 --> 00:26:50,020
What's going on is
that I am a grown woman,

714
00:26:50,022 --> 00:26:51,354
and I don't need to be
told what to do by someone

715
00:26:51,356 --> 00:26:53,557
with less experience
as a lawyer than me.

716
00:26:53,559 --> 00:26:55,425
Then you're really gonna
hate being told what to do

717
00:26:55,427 --> 00:26:57,460
by someone with no experience
as a lawyer.

718
00:26:57,462 --> 00:26:59,162
- Donna--
- Excuse me?

719
00:26:59,164 --> 00:27:00,597
I said, you're here,
and I'm here.

720
00:27:00,599 --> 00:27:02,399
So unless you want
to deal with me,

721
00:27:02,401 --> 00:27:04,868
you'll listen when Rachel
tells you something.

722
00:27:04,870 --> 00:27:08,138
I was recruited to come here.

723
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:10,340
And I was told that
I would be valued

724
00:27:10,342 --> 00:27:12,142
for my mind, my billings,

725
00:27:12,144 --> 00:27:13,577
and my relationship
with my clients.

726
00:27:13,579 --> 00:27:15,312
And since I got here,

727
00:27:15,314 --> 00:27:17,314
I have had to take shit
from Louis.

728
00:27:17,316 --> 00:27:19,549
And now you're asking me
to waste my time and my ability

729
00:27:19,551 --> 00:27:21,184
on something like this.

730
00:27:21,186 --> 00:27:23,119
- Okay--
- You're right, Stephanie.

731
00:27:23,121 --> 00:27:24,454
You shouldn't have been
treated like that by Louis.

732
00:27:24,456 --> 00:27:26,156
And Rachel and I
took care of it.

733
00:27:26,158 --> 00:27:28,258
Now as for your
time and ability,

734
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:30,460
if you don't do whatever
assignment Rachel gives you,

735
00:27:30,462 --> 00:27:32,429
I don't give a shit
how good you are.

736
00:27:32,431 --> 00:27:34,197
We are gonna show you the door.

737
00:27:52,675 --> 00:27:54,586
Hey. Did you come by
to tell me

738
00:27:54,588 --> 00:27:56,021
that the work I did
saved your ass?

739
00:27:56,023 --> 00:27:59,357
It did, but that's
not why I'm here.

740
00:27:59,359 --> 00:28:00,992
Harvey, what's going on?

741
00:28:00,994 --> 00:28:03,461
You have to drop
your pro bono.

742
00:28:03,463 --> 00:28:04,929
There's a conflict with one
of our clients.

743
00:28:04,931 --> 00:28:06,031
What? Who?
I checked for conflicts

744
00:28:06,033 --> 00:28:07,932
before I took the case.

745
00:28:07,934 --> 00:28:09,000
- It's a new client.
- Well, if it's a new client,

746
00:28:09,002 --> 00:28:10,468
then let's drop them.

747
00:28:10,470 --> 00:28:11,936
We can't.
They're a huge developer.

748
00:28:11,938 --> 00:28:13,338
A developer?
I'm suing a prison.

749
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:14,706
I know that,
but they're saying--

750
00:28:14,708 --> 00:28:16,474
I don't care what
they're saying.

751
00:28:16,476 --> 00:28:17,575
That's not a conflict.
That's a shakedown.

752
00:28:17,577 --> 00:28:18,977
- Mike--
- No.

753
00:28:18,979 --> 00:28:20,078
You're gonna give me
the green light,

754
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:22,314
and then I find something,

755
00:28:22,316 --> 00:28:23,348
and then you're gonna make me
dump them for no good reason?

756
00:28:23,350 --> 00:28:24,916
It's not no good reason.

757
00:28:24,918 --> 00:28:27,385
It's Alex's developer,
and I just brought him in.

758
00:28:27,387 --> 00:28:28,953
I let him lose one
of his biggest clients

759
00:28:28,955 --> 00:28:30,989
his first week here,
it's a disaster.

760
00:28:30,991 --> 00:28:32,691
And I let a man die
without getting him justice.

761
00:28:32,693 --> 00:28:34,559
What the hell is that?
Listen to me--

762
00:28:34,561 --> 00:28:36,428
Listen to yourself.
We had a deal.

763
00:28:36,430 --> 00:28:38,563
Now this clown is asking me
to drop a client

764
00:28:38,565 --> 00:28:40,398
that I made a promise to.

765
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:42,367
Except he's not asking you
to drop him, Mike.

766
00:28:42,369 --> 00:28:46,071
I am. And if you don't,
that deal we made--it's over.

767
00:28:53,647 --> 00:28:55,046
How could you do that?

768
00:28:55,048 --> 00:28:57,015
Do what? I was helping you.

769
00:28:57,017 --> 00:28:59,651
No, Donna, you were
undermining me.

770
00:28:59,653 --> 00:29:01,386
Undermining you?

771
00:29:01,388 --> 00:29:03,054
You needed backup.
That's what I'm here for.

772
00:29:03,056 --> 00:29:05,023
No, I needed to handle
the situation,

773
00:29:05,025 --> 00:29:07,525
which is what I was doing
until you decided to interfere

774
00:29:07,527 --> 00:29:09,627
in something that you don't
know anything about.

775
00:29:09,629 --> 00:29:12,097
No offense, Rachel, but I did
know something about it,

776
00:29:12,099 --> 00:29:14,132
and from what I could tell,
you weren't handling it at all.

777
00:29:14,134 --> 00:29:16,067
And you think what you did
was any better?

778
00:29:16,069 --> 00:29:18,136
I think I told you that you
need to set the tone early on.

779
00:29:18,138 --> 00:29:20,071
Okay, and the tone
that you just set

780
00:29:20,073 --> 00:29:23,608
is that if you're not there,
she can walk all over me.

781
00:29:23,610 --> 00:29:24,709
Well, I don't know
what room you were in,

782
00:29:24,711 --> 00:29:26,544
but she was doing that anyway.

783
00:29:26,546 --> 00:29:28,012
And what does it say about me
if the other associates

784
00:29:28,014 --> 00:29:29,781
see me letting her do that?

785
00:29:29,783 --> 00:29:31,750
What it says is that you
trust my leadership style

786
00:29:31,752 --> 00:29:33,518
instead of thinking that you
need to fight my fights for me.

787
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:35,086
Stephanie needed
what I gave her.

788
00:29:35,088 --> 00:29:37,389
And if you think that was
me fighting your fights,

789
00:29:37,391 --> 00:29:38,490
you don't know what
you're talking about.

790
00:29:38,492 --> 00:29:39,691
Because if it were up to me,

791
00:29:39,693 --> 00:29:40,759
I would've fired her
on the spot.

792
00:29:40,761 --> 00:29:42,160
Well then, why didn't you?

793
00:29:42,162 --> 00:29:43,628
Because they're not
my associates.

794
00:29:43,630 --> 00:29:44,996
You're right.
They're mine.

795
00:29:44,998 --> 00:29:46,131
And I fought for you
to get them.

796
00:29:46,133 --> 00:29:47,966
And you just belittled me

797
00:29:47,968 --> 00:29:50,402
and embarrassed me
in front of all of them.

798
00:29:50,404 --> 00:29:51,703
And that is not something that I

799
00:29:51,705 --> 00:29:53,805
thought my friend
would do to me.

800
00:29:53,807 --> 00:29:55,573
Well, you know what, I never
thought I would say this,

801
00:29:55,575 --> 00:29:57,575
but maybe you weren't
ready for your new position.

802
00:29:57,577 --> 00:29:59,043
Well, you know what, Donna?

803
00:29:59,045 --> 00:30:00,612
Maybe neither were you.

804
00:30:05,152 --> 00:30:07,719
Dr. Lipschitz, I, uh--
I know you're in a session.

805
00:30:07,721 --> 00:30:09,554
I just wanted to say
that you were right.

806
00:30:09,556 --> 00:30:11,689
Uh, I was overreacting.

807
00:30:11,691 --> 00:30:13,558
I do not have a problem
with Alex.

808
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:15,660
And, uh, if I ever
get triggered again,

809
00:30:15,662 --> 00:30:17,662
I have the deep breathing.

810
00:30:17,664 --> 00:30:19,197
Anyway, thanks again.

811
00:30:19,199 --> 00:30:21,065
Auf Wiedersehen.

812
00:30:21,067 --> 00:30:22,734
Mike.

813
00:30:22,736 --> 00:30:24,602
It's good to see you.

814
00:30:24,604 --> 00:30:26,471
This'll just take a few minutes,
and then it's all yours.

815
00:30:26,473 --> 00:30:28,473
No, it doesn't matter
how long it takes, Louis.

816
00:30:28,475 --> 00:30:30,208
We can just charge the time
back to some client, right?

817
00:30:30,210 --> 00:30:32,177
'Cause nobody around here
gives a shit about anything

818
00:30:32,179 --> 00:30:33,478
other than making money anyway.

819
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:35,447
Mike, what is going on?

820
00:30:35,449 --> 00:30:37,115
What's going on is that
the only reason I came back here

821
00:30:37,117 --> 00:30:38,516
is that Harvey and I
made a deal,

822
00:30:38,518 --> 00:30:39,851
and it hasn't even
been a week,

823
00:30:39,853 --> 00:30:41,719
and he's already going
back on it.

824
00:30:41,721 --> 00:30:42,754
Whoa, whoa, whoa, that's not
gonna happen on my watch.

825
00:30:42,756 --> 00:30:44,456
Okay? So just slow down.

826
00:30:44,458 --> 00:30:46,138
Tell me what the hell
you're talking about.

827
00:30:50,864 --> 00:30:52,630
Harvey, we need to talk.

828
00:30:52,632 --> 00:30:54,165
Mike just told me you're
breaking a deal with him.

829
00:30:54,167 --> 00:30:55,667
Well, he shouldn't have
told you that,

830
00:30:55,669 --> 00:30:56,835
because that's none
of your business.

831
00:30:56,837 --> 00:30:58,536
None of my business?

832
00:30:58,538 --> 00:31:00,104
My name's on the wall
as much as yours.

833
00:31:00,106 --> 00:31:02,507
Look, if Mike
doesn't drop that case,

834
00:31:02,509 --> 00:31:03,775
we lose a major client.

835
00:31:03,777 --> 00:31:05,643
I can't have that.
- No, Harvey.

836
00:31:05,645 --> 00:31:07,545
What we can't have is
you setting a precedent

837
00:31:07,547 --> 00:31:10,615
that Alex's clients can run
roughshod all over us.

838
00:31:10,617 --> 00:31:11,616
Keep your voices down.

839
00:31:11,618 --> 00:31:13,518
Oh, I get it.

840
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:15,086
So this isn't about me
breaking my deal with Mike.

841
00:31:15,088 --> 00:31:17,088
This is about you being
jealous of Alex.

842
00:31:17,090 --> 00:31:18,823
No, it isn't.
I thought it was a mistake

843
00:31:18,825 --> 00:31:20,692
even before I found out
that it was Alex's client.

844
00:31:20,694 --> 00:31:22,527
- Harvey, he has a point.
- Bullshit.

845
00:31:22,529 --> 00:31:24,262
You told me you were afraid
that I was gonna become

846
00:31:24,264 --> 00:31:26,865
better friends with him than
you, and that's what this is.

847
00:31:26,867 --> 00:31:29,667
How dare you say that to me in
front of Donna?

848
00:31:29,669 --> 00:31:33,705
I told you that in
complete confidence.

849
00:31:33,707 --> 00:31:36,207
This isn't about my
relationship with Alex.

850
00:31:36,209 --> 00:31:37,842
This is about your
relationship with Alex

851
00:31:37,844 --> 00:31:39,677
and how you're afraid
to stand up to him.

852
00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:41,679
You want to run that
by me again?

853
00:31:41,681 --> 00:31:43,214
I just ran it by you.

854
00:31:43,216 --> 00:31:45,216
What you are doing
is a mistake.

855
00:31:45,218 --> 00:31:46,718
I don't think so,

856
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:48,586
and Donna doesn't think so,
which means--

857
00:31:48,588 --> 00:31:50,522
Actually, Harvey, I do.

858
00:31:50,524 --> 00:31:52,624
And if it's all the same to you,
I can speak for myself.

859
00:31:52,626 --> 00:31:55,660
- Are you kidding me?
- No, I'm not.

860
00:31:55,662 --> 00:31:57,795
Because the last time you said
if I had something to say,

861
00:31:57,797 --> 00:31:59,230
say it in the goddamn meeting.

862
00:31:59,232 --> 00:32:01,199
Well, this is the goddamn
meeting.

863
00:32:01,201 --> 00:32:03,134
And I happen to think we should
keep our word to Mike

864
00:32:03,136 --> 00:32:04,736
instead of letting some client
bully us.

865
00:32:04,738 --> 00:32:06,738
Well, I appreciate the input.

866
00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:08,940
But I told you you'd
get a vote

867
00:32:08,942 --> 00:32:11,109
when I said there'd be a vote,

868
00:32:11,111 --> 00:32:12,710
and this isn't a vote.

869
00:32:12,712 --> 00:32:15,313
As for you, take a look
in the mirror,

870
00:32:15,315 --> 00:32:18,316
because the only reason
that you're pissed about this

871
00:32:18,318 --> 00:32:21,586
is your new honeysuckle friend
canceled lunch on you for me.

872
00:32:29,596 --> 00:32:31,195
Louis...

873
00:32:39,672 --> 00:32:41,241
Aren't you a little old to be
spending your break

874
00:32:41,243 --> 00:32:43,143
in a comic book store?

875
00:32:43,145 --> 00:32:44,278
Everybody has their
hobbies, Mike.

876
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:45,479
Mine's comics.

877
00:32:45,481 --> 00:32:47,147
Yours is helping big
corporations

878
00:32:47,149 --> 00:32:48,482
screw over the little guy.

879
00:32:50,186 --> 00:32:52,586
Oliver, wait.

880
00:32:52,588 --> 00:32:55,422
I just, I came here
because I owe you an apology,

881
00:32:55,424 --> 00:32:58,158
and...
this is my way of doing it.

882
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:59,426
What's that?

883
00:32:59,428 --> 00:33:01,161
More money
to make everything okay?

884
00:33:01,163 --> 00:33:03,530
It's a case.
It's one that means a lot to me.

885
00:33:03,532 --> 00:33:05,566
It's about a guy
who died in prison.

886
00:33:05,568 --> 00:33:07,568
If it means so much to you,
why don't you do it yourself?

887
00:33:07,570 --> 00:33:09,570
I can't.

888
00:33:09,572 --> 00:33:12,573
We have a conflict
with one of our clients.

889
00:33:12,575 --> 00:33:15,442
Well, that's a nice speech,
Mike, but I'm not interested,

890
00:33:15,444 --> 00:33:17,511
because there's something in it
for you, like always.

891
00:33:17,513 --> 00:33:18,879
Oliver, please,
look, before you say no,

892
00:33:18,881 --> 00:33:20,447
just listen
to what I have to say.

893
00:33:20,449 --> 00:33:22,449
I don't need to listen
to you anymore.

894
00:33:22,451 --> 00:33:24,318
God damn it,
I almost died in there.

895
00:33:28,357 --> 00:33:30,424
What?

896
00:33:34,196 --> 00:33:35,496
My second night in Danbury,

897
00:33:35,498 --> 00:33:37,498
I thought
that someone was gonna kill me.

898
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:39,199
And then my last night,

899
00:33:39,201 --> 00:33:42,136
I knew that same guy
was coming for me again.

900
00:33:42,138 --> 00:33:43,637
But I got out.

901
00:33:45,207 --> 00:33:47,174
This kid didn't.

902
00:33:48,210 --> 00:33:49,710
The only thing
that's in this for me

903
00:33:49,712 --> 00:33:53,547
is making sure that this
doesn't happen to someone else.

904
00:34:00,222 --> 00:34:01,622
This seems
pretty cut-and-dry, Mike.

905
00:34:01,624 --> 00:34:04,358
That's how they want it
to look.

906
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:05,492
I already know they didn't have
enough guard staff

907
00:34:05,494 --> 00:34:07,461
on duty that night.

908
00:34:08,597 --> 00:34:09,730
Which means
they probably didn't have

909
00:34:09,732 --> 00:34:11,231
enough medical staff either.

910
00:34:11,233 --> 00:34:12,733
Or maybe none at all.

911
00:34:12,735 --> 00:34:14,935
Look, I can't let them
get away with this

912
00:34:14,937 --> 00:34:16,503
without handing it off
to the one lawyer

913
00:34:16,505 --> 00:34:18,672
I know cares enough
to see it through.

914
00:34:21,744 --> 00:34:24,378
Okay, Mike.

915
00:34:24,380 --> 00:34:25,679
I'm in.

916
00:34:31,253 --> 00:34:34,288
- Donna, whatever it is--
- Rachel, I'm so sorry.

917
00:34:34,290 --> 00:34:35,722
What I did was wrong
and horrible

918
00:34:35,724 --> 00:34:37,424
and showed you no respect,

919
00:34:37,426 --> 00:34:38,759
and then you came
and tried to tell me that,

920
00:34:38,761 --> 00:34:41,395
and I made it
a thousand times worse.

921
00:34:41,397 --> 00:34:44,264
Why would you do something
like that in the first place?

922
00:34:44,266 --> 00:34:45,632
'Cause I'm new at this.

923
00:34:46,769 --> 00:34:48,669
Then I saw Stephanie
treating you like shit,

924
00:34:48,671 --> 00:34:51,538
and it felt like
she was doing that to me.

925
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:53,674
Because you're the one
that gave me the job.

926
00:34:53,676 --> 00:34:56,276
Maybe.

927
00:34:56,278 --> 00:34:57,678
And then you told me
I cut your legs out,

928
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:59,446
and that made me
feel even worse,

929
00:34:59,448 --> 00:35:00,681
and I took it out on you.

930
00:35:00,683 --> 00:35:02,616
- Donna--
- Rachel, you were right.

931
00:35:02,618 --> 00:35:04,718
I'm not completely ready
for this.

932
00:35:06,789 --> 00:35:08,555
And I'm not always
gonna get things right,

933
00:35:08,557 --> 00:35:11,658
and I got them
really wrong today.

934
00:35:14,296 --> 00:35:16,463
Maybe not all wrong.

935
00:35:16,465 --> 00:35:18,565
What do you mean?

936
00:35:20,569 --> 00:35:23,337
I thought about it too.

937
00:35:23,339 --> 00:35:28,675
I am finally a member
of the bar.

938
00:35:33,749 --> 00:35:36,316
I don't want to supervise
anyone right now.

939
00:35:36,318 --> 00:35:39,019
I just want to be
the best lawyer I can be.

940
00:35:39,021 --> 00:35:40,854
I understand.

941
00:35:42,458 --> 00:35:44,825
I'll take care of
the associates for now.

942
00:35:46,462 --> 00:35:47,828
Donna.

943
00:35:47,830 --> 00:35:49,496
What made you realize all that?

944
00:35:49,498 --> 00:35:50,797
Let's just say

945
00:35:50,799 --> 00:35:52,733
I was reminded
what it feels like

946
00:35:52,735 --> 00:35:54,835
when someone speaks for you
and what they're saying

947
00:35:54,837 --> 00:35:58,338
is the complete opposite
of what you wanted to say.

948
00:35:58,340 --> 00:36:00,841
- Louis?
- Harvey.

949
00:36:00,843 --> 00:36:03,644
The one who gave you
your new position.

950
00:36:03,646 --> 00:36:05,312
Exactly.

951
00:36:05,314 --> 00:36:07,514
I'm so sorry, Donna.

952
00:36:07,516 --> 00:36:09,516
I'm sorry too, Rachel.

953
00:36:17,459 --> 00:36:18,859
Harvey, it's late.
Whatever it is--

954
00:36:18,861 --> 00:36:22,629
Did you pawn that thing off
to the clinic?

955
00:36:22,631 --> 00:36:24,464
You asked me to drop it,
so I dropped it.

956
00:36:24,466 --> 00:36:26,366
Bullshit.

957
00:36:26,368 --> 00:36:27,734
You gave it to the clinic
you're affiliated with.

958
00:36:27,736 --> 00:36:29,469
The clinic you told me
I could give cases to

959
00:36:29,471 --> 00:36:30,604
at my discretion.

960
00:36:30,606 --> 00:36:32,539
Maybe you missed the memo.

961
00:36:32,541 --> 00:36:35,375
If our firm is in any way
associated with that case,

962
00:36:35,377 --> 00:36:36,576
we lose a huge client.

963
00:36:36,578 --> 00:36:38,078
Harvey, I'm not working on it.

964
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:39,780
Then you're gonna put that
in writing,

965
00:36:39,782 --> 00:36:40,881
and you're gonna deliver it
to Alex's client.

966
00:36:40,883 --> 00:36:42,616
Ironclad Chinese wall.

967
00:36:42,618 --> 00:36:43,917
You have nothing to do
with this case.

968
00:36:43,919 --> 00:36:46,453
Are you saying
you don't trust me?

969
00:36:46,455 --> 00:36:47,654
You saying you didn't know
what you were doing

970
00:36:47,656 --> 00:36:49,623
when you gave it to the clinic?

971
00:36:51,894 --> 00:36:53,660
Okay, Harvey.

972
00:36:53,662 --> 00:36:55,362
I'll put it in writing.

973
00:36:57,399 --> 00:36:58,532
I want you word
you're gonna live

974
00:36:58,534 --> 00:37:00,367
by what you sign.

975
00:37:01,804 --> 00:37:03,537
You have my word.

976
00:37:09,912 --> 00:37:11,912
You wanted to see me?

977
00:37:11,914 --> 00:37:13,814
Yes, I did,
I was just wondering,

978
00:37:13,816 --> 00:37:17,684
have you redone the assignment
that Rachel gave you?

979
00:37:17,686 --> 00:37:18,719
Not yet.

980
00:37:18,721 --> 00:37:20,787
I had a ton on my plate.

981
00:37:20,789 --> 00:37:22,889
I was gonna get to it tomorrow.

982
00:37:24,827 --> 00:37:26,460
You're fired.

983
00:37:27,563 --> 00:37:29,963
Please,
I-I really was going to do it.

984
00:37:29,965 --> 00:37:31,832
I believe you.

985
00:37:31,834 --> 00:37:33,700
But my rule is
three strikes and you're out.

986
00:37:33,702 --> 00:37:35,936
Otherwise, where does it end?

987
00:37:35,938 --> 00:37:38,572
In that case,
why not do this publicly?

988
00:37:38,574 --> 00:37:40,841
I don't need to do this
publicly, Stephanie.

989
00:37:40,843 --> 00:37:43,844
When you're not here tomorrow,
people will know what happened.

990
00:37:43,846 --> 00:37:47,714
But I do want you to know,
I wish you well.

991
00:37:47,716 --> 00:37:49,950
Do you expect me
to believe that?

992
00:37:49,952 --> 00:37:51,451
I don't know.

993
00:37:51,453 --> 00:37:52,953
But it's true.

994
00:38:09,605 --> 00:38:11,438
Before you say anything,

995
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:12,973
I came here for a reason.

996
00:38:12,975 --> 00:38:14,975
Because this is where we met,

997
00:38:14,977 --> 00:38:17,444
but it isn't where
I need to be anymore.

998
00:38:17,446 --> 00:38:18,812
Harvey, I don't think--

999
00:38:18,814 --> 00:38:20,647
I just have one question
to ask you.

1000
00:38:20,649 --> 00:38:22,983
Are you worried about
what this woman's gonna think

1001
00:38:22,985 --> 00:38:24,985
or because you think
what we're doing is wrong?

1002
00:38:24,987 --> 00:38:27,621
Because if this is just about
what other people think,

1003
00:38:27,623 --> 00:38:28,789
it's crazy.

1004
00:38:28,791 --> 00:38:30,891
Well, it isn't crazy to me,

1005
00:38:30,893 --> 00:38:31,958
and I need you
to understand that.

1006
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:33,593
I do understand that,

1007
00:38:33,595 --> 00:38:34,995
but I also know
we have a connection,

1008
00:38:34,997 --> 00:38:36,763
and to throw that away

1009
00:38:36,765 --> 00:38:38,799
because of some figment
of your imagination--

1010
00:38:38,801 --> 00:38:41,501
It is not a figment
of my imagination.

1011
00:38:41,503 --> 00:38:43,503
And I'm not worried
about what she thinks.

1012
00:38:43,505 --> 00:38:46,673
I am worried about what I think.
- And what is it that you think?

1013
00:38:46,675 --> 00:38:48,742
That what if this was
a terrible mistake

1014
00:38:48,744 --> 00:38:50,544
and it doesn't work out

1015
00:38:50,546 --> 00:38:52,612
and I look like a fool?

1016
00:38:54,016 --> 00:38:56,016
Okay.

1017
00:38:56,018 --> 00:38:59,553
I know
I'm not the therapist here,

1018
00:38:59,555 --> 00:39:01,822
but isn't that the risk
of any relationship?

1019
00:39:04,693 --> 00:39:07,594
I'm scared, Harvey.

1020
00:39:07,596 --> 00:39:08,862
Me too.

1021
00:39:10,933 --> 00:39:13,600
What do you say
we both be scared together?

1022
00:39:21,677 --> 00:39:24,544
Can I help you?

1023
00:39:24,546 --> 00:39:25,946
Yeah.

1024
00:39:25,948 --> 00:39:28,014
My name is Mike Ross.

1025
00:39:28,016 --> 00:39:29,850
I would say nice to meet you,

1026
00:39:29,852 --> 00:39:31,952
but I'm pretty sure
you don't feel the same way.

1027
00:39:31,954 --> 00:39:34,254
Not particularly.

1028
00:39:34,256 --> 00:39:35,755
What's this?

1029
00:39:35,757 --> 00:39:37,991
My next 15 potential lawsuits.

1030
00:39:37,993 --> 00:39:39,059
I just want to make sure
you don't have any conflicts

1031
00:39:39,061 --> 00:39:40,560
with any of these.

1032
00:39:40,562 --> 00:39:41,828
Maybe your client's grandmother

1033
00:39:41,830 --> 00:39:43,563
shops at the supermarket

1034
00:39:43,565 --> 00:39:45,065
across the street
from number 12.

1035
00:39:45,067 --> 00:39:47,701
I'll take a look.

1036
00:39:47,703 --> 00:39:49,569
Good, 'cause just to be clear,

1037
00:39:49,571 --> 00:39:50,804
if I'd known
there was a conflict,

1038
00:39:50,806 --> 00:39:52,806
I never would've taken the case.

1039
00:39:54,076 --> 00:39:55,942
I appreciate you dropping it.

1040
00:39:55,944 --> 00:39:57,844
I was bulldozed
into dropping it,

1041
00:39:57,846 --> 00:40:00,680
just like I was bulldozed
into signing this.

1042
00:40:01,984 --> 00:40:04,584
Now, I can live with
both those things,

1043
00:40:04,586 --> 00:40:06,019
but I never want to get caught
in this situation again.

1044
00:40:06,021 --> 00:40:09,623
What's so funny?

1045
00:40:09,625 --> 00:40:12,626
I just told my client
the same damn thing.

1046
00:40:12,628 --> 00:40:14,628
Bullshit.

1047
00:40:14,630 --> 00:40:16,129
You think
this makes me look good?

1048
00:40:17,866 --> 00:40:20,700
Well then I guess we're in
the same boat after all.

1049
00:40:21,803 --> 00:40:23,703
It's nice to meet you, Mike.

1050
00:40:24,873 --> 00:40:26,540
Welcome
to Pearson Specter Litt.

1051
00:40:28,877 --> 00:40:31,912
<i>You said I needed a strategy</i>
<i>for when it happened.</i>

1052
00:40:31,914 --> 00:40:34,014
Well, I used your strategy,
and I got over it,

1053
00:40:34,016 --> 00:40:36,116
but it didn't fix
a goddamn thing!

1054
00:40:36,118 --> 00:40:40,153
Louis, calm down.
I'm here for you.

1055
00:40:40,155 --> 00:40:42,122
No, you're not!
You're never there for me.

1056
00:40:42,124 --> 00:40:43,790
You're always against me.

1057
00:40:43,792 --> 00:40:45,759
<i>I did what you said,</i>

1058
00:40:45,761 --> 00:40:47,794
<i>and this time,</i>
<i>it's not my fault.</i>

1059
00:40:47,796 --> 00:40:50,897
And I don't give a shit
what you think.

1060
00:40:50,899 --> 00:40:53,133
I'm not the horrible person
you always say I am.

1061
00:40:53,135 --> 00:40:55,135
Louis, I don't think
you're a horrible person.

1062
00:40:55,137 --> 00:40:57,137
I think
you're a wonderful person.

1063
00:40:57,139 --> 00:40:58,939
And if I haven't made
that clear to you,

1064
00:40:58,941 --> 00:41:00,707
I am very sorry.

1065
00:41:00,709 --> 00:41:02,809
Well, you can be sorry
all you want, Harvey.

1066
00:41:02,811 --> 00:41:04,811
- Louis?
<i>- But you are wrong about me.</i>

1067
00:41:04,813 --> 00:41:07,681
I'm not
a worthless piece of shit.

1068
00:41:07,683 --> 00:41:09,182
<i>You failed me.</i>

1069
00:41:10,085 --> 00:41:12,085
And you were wrong.

1070
00:41:12,087 --> 00:41:13,987
<i>You were wrong!</i>
